HTML-CalendarMonth
-------------------

HTML::CalendarMonth is a module that simplifies the rendering of a
calendar month in HTML.  It is NOT a scheduling system.

Calendars are represented as HTML::Element based structures,
derived from the HTML::ElementTable class.

The module includes support for 'week of the year' numbering,
arbitrary 1st day of the week definitions, and aliasing so that
you can express any element in any language HTML can handle.

INSTALLATION

You install HTML-Calendar, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

See HTML/CalendarMonth.pm for the code. See Changes for recent
changes. POD style documentation is included in the module.
This is normally converted to a manual page and installed as part
of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use
the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read documentation from the
module directly.
