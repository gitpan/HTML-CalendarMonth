Revision history for Perl extension HTML-CalendarMonth.

1.09  Tue Mar 26 05:21:59 CST 2002
	- Fixed obscure bug that caused March 31 2002
	  to be dropped; related to a localtime/gmtime
	  issue with DST effects.
	- Added tests for calendars over 1-year span
	  plus special cases such as the aforementioned
	  March 31 2002 instance.

1.08  Mon Jan  8 19:15:16 CST 2001
	- Added Date::Manip fallback from Date::Calc,

	  or exotic dates.

	- Day-of-week bug fixed for cases where Sunday is
	  the first day of the month (such as Oct, 2000),

	  over various configurations of what is considered
	  the first day of the week.
